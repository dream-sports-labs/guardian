## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Docker** ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
* **Docker Compose CLI** ([Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
* **Maven**
* **Java 17**

### Quick Start

#### Prerequisites
You can verify the installations by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
docker --version
mvn --version
java -version
```

Ensure that **Java 17** is the active version in use. Maven should also be configured to use Java 17 - you can verify this by checking that `mvn --version` shows Java 17 in its output.

Additionally, make sure the following ports are free and not in use by other services:

* `3306` – MySQL
* `6379` – Redis
* `8080` – Application server
* `6000` – Auxiliary services/API

These ports are required for the application to run without conflicts.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dream-sports-labs/guardian.git
cd guardian
```

2. Start Guardian:
```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

3. Test the setup with a passwordless flow:

```bash
# Initialize passwordless authentication
curl --location 'localhost:8080/v1/passwordless/init' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'tenant-id: tenant1' \
--data '{
  "flow": "signinup",
  "responseType": "token",
  "contacts": [{
    "channel": "sms",
    "identifier": "9999999999"
  }],
  "metaInfo": {
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "location": "localhost",
    "deviceName": "localhost",
    "source": "app"
  }
}'

# Complete authentication (using mock OTP for development)
curl --location 'localhost:8080/v1/passwordless/complete' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'tenant-id: tenant1' \
--data '{
  "state": "<state-from-init-response>",
  "otp": "999999"
}'
```
